# CloudNotes

Check out the [deployed](https://intense-sea-86093.herokuapp.com/) web page on Heroku 
# Get started 

You can clone or fork the repository in the upper right hand corner. Once you get a local copy downloaded into your machine, cd into the frontend folder and run 'npm install'. This should install all of the dependancies used in this project. Then, run 'npm start' to run the web page. 

## Technologies Used 

For the frontend, I used the ReactJS framework. I also used the command line tool Create React App to get started with this project. 

The dependancies I used: 
* Axios to make the API calls to Flickr 
* React-Router-Dom for routing 
* ECMAScript 6
